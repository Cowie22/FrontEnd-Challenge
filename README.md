# FrontEnd-Challenge
```
FrontEnd Challenge for a potential position at Hatchways
```

### Summary

```
This application is a challenge completed for a potential position
The data displayed comes from an api and is styled according to the instructions
Clicking the plus sign will show more info about the student and allow one to add tags for that particular student
Both names and tags can be used to filter the students simultaneously, which is shown at the top of the app
This is a front-end challenge, had there been, otherwise I would have set up a database of my own so that tags could be saved on refresh
