# FrontEnd-Challenge
```
FrontEnd Challenge for a potential position at Hatchways
```

### Summary

```
This application is a challenge completed for a potential professional position and displays students,
As well as their image, pertinent information and test scores.  Furthermore, the app allows one to add tags
For any student, as well as search by these tags and by the students name.  The searches work congruently, so one can refine their search.
The data displayed comes from an api and is styled according to the project instructions
Clicking the '+' logo will show more information about the particular student and allow one to add tags for that particular student.  Of course the '-' logo will minimize this information.
Both names and tags can be used to filter the students simultaneously, which is shown at the top of the app
This is a front-end challenge, otherwise I would have set up a database of my own, so that tags could be saved on refresh and so that the dynamic features could have been written more cleanly.
It is a little obnoxious that the tags are not saved on refresh and this is why full-stack engineering is so beneficial.
I would have also added features that allow one to delete tags, etc..
Finally, it should be noted that will a full stack app, such operations as filtering become much more clean.  I would have implemented this as well.
